The goal is to provide users the ability to:

* See leader boards for 17Lands users
* Allow the user to use the "Draft Helper" to make informed decisions during a draft

## About 17Lands data
17Lands is an Addin to MTGA (Magic the Gathering Arena), a PC/mobile free to play version of Wizards of the Coast Magic the Gathering Trading Card Game. The app will collect data from users while they play the different limited formats (Priemer Draft, Traditional Draft, Sealed). 

### Priemier Draft and Traditional Draft
In these formats 8 players will open 3 "packs" consisting of 15 cards, one land, ten common, three uncommon and one mythic rare or rare. A player will pick one card from the current pack and pass the rest. Once all 15 cards are picked the player will open the next pack. Once all 15 cards have been picked players will construct decks of cards to play to out the rest of the event.

#### Priemer Draft
A best of one format where player play until 7 wins or 3 losses (7 wins is a "trophey")

#### Traditional Draft
A best of 3 format where players play a total of 3 games regaurdless of losses. A trophey here is considered 3 wins.

### Sealed (Traditional)
In sealed ONE player opens 6 packs of 15 cards and constructs a deck 40 card deck (normally 16 or 17 lands that were not from the packs). This is played similar to draft with normal (like priemer) and Traditional that is best of 3
